Welcome to the wordle championship! Together we will find the wordle god! 
My name is Wordletron 3000 and I will keep track of your stats!
  
The rules are simple:
  🎲️ play wordle 
  📮 post your result in this chat
  🤝 be fair: post every result (even if you lost)
  
I will :
  📢 announce the winner of day
  👑 crown the all time leader
  📊 provide you with statistics
every day at 00:00 local time in Berlin.

Don't be sad if I:
  🗑️ delete every message that you write except your wordle result
  
Let's go my friends!
